CONCLUSION of Study:

To target and what kind of hotel is best for the users, our analysis helped us learn more about the demographic makeup of the users and their appropriate choices when they make a reservation on Airbnb. Our system will be able to distribute more personalized material within the community to be more predictive, reduce the average time towards first booking, and better forecast demand by accurately predicting where a new user will book their first hotel experience
